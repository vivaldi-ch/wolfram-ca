## Introduction
This is a sample project I did to learn about gatsby and react in general. This project is now using Circle CI for continuous integration.

This project is based on https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default.

You can visit https://vivaldi-ch.github.io/wolfram-ca/ for an example of this project.

## How to Run
1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and run `nvm use`.
2. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `gatsby develop` in your terminal.
4. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser.

## TODO
- [ ] Host website properly in CDN to utilise gatsby's real power.
- [x] Adds unit tests. (Partially)
- [x] Do CI/CD.
