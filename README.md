## Introduction
This is a sample project I did to learn about gatsby and react in general.

This project is based on https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default.

## How to Run
1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and run `nvm use`.
2. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `gatsby develop` in your terminal.
4. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser.

## TODO
1. Host website properly in CDN to utilise gatsby's real power.
2. Adds unit tests.
3. Do CI/CD.
